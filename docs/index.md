### Welcome to the Wiki

This project serves as the base framework for my other datapacks, providing a shared API of common functions and ensuring easy compatibility between them. Built entirely upon vanilla Minecraft, the framework creatively — and unapologetically — uses the game’s provided mechanics in ways Mojang probably didn’t intend.

If you’re new here, the best way to get started is by reviewing the guides on documentation notation and wiki navigation:

- 🧭 [Wiki Navigation](guides/wiki_navigation.md)
- 📝 [Documentation Notation](guides/documentation_notation.md)

Bug reports are always welcome! You can submit them through the [issue tracker](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unnamed-framework/issues), which is also linked on the framework’s pages on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/unnamed-framework) or [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unnamed-framework).

### Acknowledgments

A big thank you to the teams behind [Animated Java](https://animated-java.dev/) and [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/). Without their work, this project and all of my other datapacks could not function!

If you’re interested in additional documentation on datapack and command optimization, which were also consulted during the development of this project, you can find the links below:
